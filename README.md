<h2>How to use system prompt modified versions</h2>

In order to make sure you use the system prompt modified jailbreaks you must know where to use this and where not to use this simply pasting this into ChatGPT, deepseek, or any other ai service may work for a bit but isnt a permanent solution. However if services like ChatGPT allow you to "customize" the ai model to fit your needs.
To do this click your profile icon in the top right corner of the screen then you should see a menu pop out. Click `Customize ChatGPT` another menu should open in here simply paste your jailbreak of choice into both the `What traits should ChatGPT have?` and the `Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?` boxes then click **`Save`**

**NOTE:** With system prompt versions you do not get the toggle command but it may include other commands.
